# VimConfig

Nothing fancy here. I'm just sharing my vim config and the commands mostly copied from a lot places.

# Installation

I'm a NeoVim user. So the installation is Neovim specific.

```shell
./installation.sh
```

There is an option for triggering Zypper before installation. (For OpenSUSE)

```shell
./installation.sh --zypper
```

If you prefer Vim, you may tweak the installation script for your editor. Or, just install VimPlug and rename "init.vim" as ".vimrc"

Note that I have not tried this script.
